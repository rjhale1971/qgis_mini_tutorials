I have a line in EPSG:2274. I want to place a point every 100 Feet.

Open your processing tool box and search for ***Points along Geometry*** 

![tool](/images/points_along_geometry.png) 

Be sure to put 100 (or wahtever you need) in the Distance text box. Click OK.

Note - you get points with the distance from starting point and an angle from 0. You can add x and y coordinates from here if you wish.
